## SAP Datasphere - Space set-up
A space is available and assigned for each participant couple. The space name is DA267_USERxx (fill xx with your user number that you find on your PC; e.g., DA267_USER01). 

## SAP Analytics Cloud - File repository
You are asked to work in 'My Files', so not in the 'Public' folder. 
You find some sample materials under 'Public/TechEd2025_DA267'. No need to check them now as they will be referred to in the exercises where they will be needed. 

Now, move on to the first real exercise. [Exercise 1 - Create planning model](../ex1_create_planning_model/ex1.1_create_DSP_view/README.md)
