## SAP Datasphere - Space set-up
A space is available and assigned for each participant couple. The space name is DA267_USERxx (fill xx with your user number that you find on your PC; e.g., DA267_USER01). 

## SAP Analytics Cloud - File repository
You are asked to work in 'My Files', so not in the 'Public' folder. You find a sample story under 'Public/TechEd2025_DA267'. Please remember to copy it to your 'My Files' when working on the respective exercises (don't copy it now, we will remind you in the distinct exercises). 

Now, move on to the first real exercise. [Exercise 1 - Create planning model](../ex1_create_planning_model/ex1.1_create_DSP_view/README.md)
