# Create the seamless planning model in SAP Analytics Cloud
In this exercise, we will use the NWC_PLANNING view from SAP Datasphere and use it to build a seamless planning model.

1. Go to the modeler in [SAP Analytics Cloud](https://trial-bdc-sac-3.eu10.sapanalytics.cloud/sap/fpa/ui/app.html#/home)

2. Create new model

3. Select SAP Datasphere and your user's space as data storage location. Selecting SAP Datasphere as data storage location means that you will use seamless planning.

4. Now you select the datasource for your model. We select SAP Datasphere. By that, we will directly create a live connection to our source view via a live version.

5. Select the voew that you created in ![exercise 1.1](../../../exercises/ex1_create_planning_model/ex1.1_create_DSP_view/README.md)

6. Now the planning model is created. Let's review the live version (no action needed). 
We see the live version in the data preview:
