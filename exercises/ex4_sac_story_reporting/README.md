# Extend SAP Analytics Cloud Story with Reporting on the Analytic Model
Now that we created the analytic model in [exercise 3.2](../ex3_analytic_model/ex3.2_analytic_model), we want to embedd it into our SAP Analytics Cloud story as well. 

1. Go back to  [SAP Analytics Cloud](https://trial-bdc-sac-3.eu10.sapanalytics.cloud/sap/fpa/ui/app.html#/home) and navigate to the story you created earlier. You can either go via the *Files/My Files* or *Stories/Recent Files*.

2.Add a canvas page.

4. Drag the header composite to the canvas as you already did already in [exercise 2](../ex2_story/README.md). Add a table as well and then change the datasource of the table.
