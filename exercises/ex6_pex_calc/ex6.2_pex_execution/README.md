# Execute the salary calculation in a story
In this exercise, we will build a table to check the values that our data action is about to calculate. We'll trigger the calculation from the same story. This is the final exercise!

1. Open your story. You can either go via the *Files/My Files* or *Stories/Recent Files*.

2. Display the left and the right side panel. Pull the composite and a table on to the canvas. Change the data source of the table.
