# Calculation of personnel expenses
Now, we want to calculate personnel expenses. We pretend that this is only base salary. Let's first understand how we want to calculate them.
We will use the following measures/accounts:
- FTE measure --> number of employees in full-time equivalents
- Salary Assumptions account --> to hold the assumed average salary per 1 FTE
- Personnel Expenses account --> to hold the calculated salary value (FTE * Salary Assumptions)

We will use a data action to calculate the salaries. But first, we need to plan salary assumptions in a story.

1. Navigate to the story you created earlier. You can either go via the *Files/My Files* or *Stories/Recent Files*.

2. Switch to edit mode and add a canvas page. Display the left and the right side panel.
